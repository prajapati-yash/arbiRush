# ArbiRun - Game Design Outline

## Core Game Loop
- Player character auto-runs forward continuously
- Every 2-3 seconds, new row of items spawns ahead across 3 lanes
- Player taps left/right to switch lanes and collect/avoid items
- Speed gradually increases every 30 seconds
- Game ends when health reaches zero or player crashes

## Mechanics

### Player Movement
- Tap left/right to switch lanes (smooth transition animation)
- Auto-run forward at increasing speed
- 3 distinct lanes with clear visual separation

### Lane Items
- **Rewards**: Tokens, yield multipliers, airdrops, staking rewards
- **Risks**: Gas fees, rugpulls, liquidations, bridge exploits
- **Obstacles**: Smart contract bugs, MEV bots (must dodge)
- **Power-ups**: Shield (temporary invincibility), magnet (auto-collect nearby rewards)

### Difficulty Progression
- Speed increases every 30 seconds (5% increment)
- More frequent obstacles after 1 minute
- Higher-value rewards/risks at higher speeds
- Multiple items per lane in later stages

## Onchain Concept Mapping

### Rewards
- **+50 ARB**: Basic token collection
- **Ã—2 Yield**: Doubles next 3 rewards
- **+100 Airdrop**: Bonus points burst
- **Staking Boost**: +25% score multiplier for 10 seconds
- **LP Rewards**: Gradual point accumulation

### Risks
- **Gas Fee**: -20 points + brief slowdown
- **Rugpull**: Lose 50% of current score
- **Liquidation**: -100 points
- **Bridge Exploit**: Lose all multipliers

## Scoring System
- Base points: 1 point per second survived
- Token collections: 10-100 points each
- Multipliers stack and decay over time
- High score leaderboard
- Session earnings display in "ARB tokens"

## Visual & UI Elements

### Game Field
- 3-lane track with Arbitrum-themed backgrounds
- Parallax scrolling cityscape with DeFi buildings
- Clear lane dividers with subtle glow effects

### HUD
- Current score (top-left)
- Active multipliers (top-center) 
- Health/shields remaining (top-right)

### Items
